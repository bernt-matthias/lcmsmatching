LC/MS matching
==============

An LC/MS matching tool for [Galaxy](https://galaxyproject.org/), part of the [Workflow4Metabolomics](http://workflow4metabolomics.org/) project, and developed during the [MetaboHUB](http://www.metabohub.fr/en) project.

The two matching algorithms used in this tool have been imported from developments made at [CEA](http://www.cea.fr/english) Saclay, inside the *DSV/IBITEC-S/SPI*. They have been translated from C# to R.

For more information, see the galaxy tool page, help section, available inside `galaxy/lcmsmatching.xml`.
